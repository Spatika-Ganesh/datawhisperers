Goal: Currently, users on Expedia can search for destinations based on activities they want to take part in using keywords. However, Expedia doesn't provde a way to filter locations, or market locations based on a user's search, while taking into account popularity scores of travel-related facets of destinations. Our approach is to map user search data with the popularities of destinations, return top interests of users, and cluster users based on their interests.
